🚀 What I'm Building
I'm a final-year IT student with a strong passion for cloud infrastructure. I am currently focused on translating academic knowledge into practical, real-world skills. Here’s what I'm actively working on:
 * ☁️ Multi-Cloud Deployment: Provisioning and managing virtual machines, storage, and networking on both AWS and Azure to understand their core differences and strengths.
 * ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Writing Terraform configurations to create reproducible environments and using Docker to containerize applications, streamlining the development-to-production pipeline.
 * 🤖 Python for Automation: Developing scripts to automate routine cloud operations, such as scheduled backups, resource tagging, and cost-monitoring alerts.
 * 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines: Implementing automated build, test, and deployment workflows for my projects using GitHub Actions, reducing manual errors and speeding up release cycles.
🛠️ My Tech Stack & Tools
| Cloud & Infrastructure | Automation & Scripting | Web & Collaboration |
|---|---|---|
| AWS Azure Docker Terraform | Python Bash | Git GitHub Actions HTML/CSS |
🤝 Open to Collaboration
I am eager to contribute my skills to meaningful projects. I am particularly interested in collaborating on:
 * Open-Source Cloud Tools: Contributing to utilities that help developers manage cloud resources.
 * DevOps Practice Labs: Building and documenting environments for learning and experimentation.
 * Automated Workflow Solutions: Creating scripts or tools that solve common, repetitive problems.
If you're looking for a passionate and dedicated collaborator, let's connect!
